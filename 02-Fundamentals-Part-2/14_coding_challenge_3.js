// Coding Challenge #3
//Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use objects to implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height)(mass in kg and height in meter)
// Your tasks:
// 1.For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height (Mark Miller and John Smith)
// 2.Create a 'calcBMI'method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same method on both objects). Store the BMI value to property, and also return it from the method
// 3.Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI.
//  Example: "John's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark's (23.9)!" 
//  Test data:Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
//  GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
